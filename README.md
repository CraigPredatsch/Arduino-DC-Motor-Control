# Arduino-DC-Motor-Control

This project is a motor that will turn on at the press of a button.
When the button is released, the motor will turn off.
The Arduino itself cannot provide enough current to operate the motor, so I use an external 9V battery and a MOSFET along with the 5V output from the Arduino to provide a higher current.
